# JavaScript-Ferrari-Fitness-Front-end
Ferrari Fitness is a front web application that I created using HTML/CSS/JavaScript/PHP. 
It is a front end application that applies responsive design, DOM manipulation with JavaScript, input validation, and calculations that are performed and sent back to the user through PHP.
